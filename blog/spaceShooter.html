                The Space Shooter is an open-source game featuring a 2D space shooting experience with multiple enemy types, power-ups, and boss battles.
                Written in Python using SDL2 library for graphics rendering, the project is designed to work on various platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS.
            </p>
            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <p>
                The design process can be compartmentalized into two key areas: the main screen and the game interface itself.
            </p>
            <h4>Main Screen</h4>
            <p>
                The main screen boasts a dynamic ambiance with a rolling background, complemented by interactive buttons for various actions.
                Users can seamlessly initiate gameplay or opt for a customized level selection right from the main window.
                Additionally, quick help prompts are strategically placed, guiding users on spacecraft operation within the game, enhancing the overall user experience.
            </p>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px">
                <div class="content-image-container">
                    <img src="/resources/blog_image/spaceShooter/intro_screen.png" alt="Blog Page" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Consistency in design extends to other screens, such as the level selection and game ending screens, which mirror the main screen's aesthetic.
                The buttons on these screens are thoughtfully crafted with a clear Call-to-Action (CTA) behavior and a hovering effect, providing users with intuitive cues for directing their actions throughout the gaming experience.
            </p>
            <h4>Game Theories</h4>
            <p>
                The gameplay is envisioned as an immersive space adventure, placing users in control of a spacecraft with the objective of shooting down various enemy spaceships.
                The game introduces three distinct types of adversaries: regular enemies, mini-bosses, and bosses.
                As users successfully destroy enemies, they accrue scores, progressing through the game.
                Upon reaching specific score thresholds, mini-bosses and bosses dynamically enter the scene, intensifying the gaming experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the gaming experience, the destruction of enemies presents opportunities for upgrade crates to drop.
                These crates encompass various classes, offering enhancements such as different weapons, shields, extra lives, and more. 
                Users have the exciting prospect of upgrading their spacecraft by strategically collecting these diverse crates as they navigate through the game.
            </p>

            </div>
            <h3>Execution</h3>
            <p>
                The game's execution primarily leverages Python and its associated libraries.
                The detailed implementation and optimization strategies encompass the utilization of various data structures, including linked lists and customized classes for efficient information storage.
                Additionally, parallelization techniques are employed for both calculations and rendering processes, ensuring a smooth and responsive gaming experience.
            </p>
            <h3>Future Implementation</h3>
            <p>
                In future implementations, enhancements are envisaged in both the gameplay and the game itself.
                A potential upgrade involves refining the score board functionality. 
                Currently, it only retains the highest score within a single gameplay session.
                A future iteration could expand its capabilities, allowing it to store and display all high scores over multiple sessions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another progressive feature could be introduced in the endless gameplay mode, incorporating a dynamic difficulty system.
                This innovation would entail a gradual increase in difficulty over time, culminating in reaching a predefined, challenging level, adding an extra layer of excitement and engagement for players.
