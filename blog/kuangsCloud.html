            <p>Kuang's Cloud, initially conceived as a private home server system for secure file storage and backup, has evolved over time.
                With a commitment to accessibility, additional features have been seamlessly integrated to transform it into a multifunctional hub. 
                Now, it not only safeguards files but also doubles as a media center and a nimble task executor, adapting to the dynamic needs of its users.</p>
            <h3>The Origin</h3>
            <p>
                The concept of constructing a compact private server first germinated in my mind several years ago, prompted primarily by my mother's increasing need to transport a substantial volume of files for work and various purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally confined to paper, the evolving digital landscape transformed these files into terabytes, echoing my mother's sentiment, "What if I require access to files collected years ago, in the moment?"
                The situation escalated as she accumulated videos, photos, and other files, eventually maxing out a couple of hard drives.
                So as a Mother's Day gift, my father and I entertained the idea of establishing a private home server to simplify things for her in a relatively "affordable" manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to public file servers, a private home server provides enhanced control, particularly in storage. Adding an extra hard drive and configuring it to the right position becomes a straightforward task. Although it requires occasional maintenance, this can be efficiently managed through automated scripts, offering a personalized and efficient solution.
            </p>
            <h3>Some Problems</h3>
            <p>
                One prominent challenge encountered was related to connection issues.
                Upon completing the server setup, there were some difficulties connecting to it.
                Through researches, it was discovered that the dedicated router was not configured properly to allow external access to the server.
                After some tinkering, the issue was resolved via solutions utilizing virtual private network (VPN).
                While this provided an effective workaround, it introduced a downside—the network speed slowed down, compromising the ideal speed for file transfers.
                Nevertheless, as the server was configured on a dedicated sub-network, distinct from the everyday network usage, the impact of the slowed network speed due to the VPN implementation was deemed insignificant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another challenge was maintaining the server online 24/7, a crucial aspect of the home server's purpose.
                To achieve this, stringent security measures were implemented, including Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and custom firewalls to ensure that only registered users could access the server.
                Additionally, protocols for power loss events and backup procedures within the RAIDed storage were established to safeguard both data and server integrity, reinforcing the overall security framework.
            </p>
            <h3>At The Moment</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, the server operates seamlessly with enhanced functionality. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It has been upgraded to perform a diverse array of tasks, encompassing automated backups, efficient file transfers, and seamless media streaming. 
                The introduction of a dynamic media center enables streaming to various devices such as smart TVs, phones, and tablets. 
                This is made possible through a media server implementation, which dynamically transcodes media files on the fly, ensuring smooth streaming compatibility across a wide range of devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, the server is equipped with the capability to execute simple scripts, offloading various tasks such as media extraction and downloads, automated file backups, and basic home automation. 
                This functionality adds a layer of automation, enhancing the server's versatility and efficiency in handling diverse tasks.
            </p>
            <h3>Future</h3>
            <p>
                The server will continue to evolve, adapting to the dynamic needs of its users. 
                Looking ahead, plans are in place for the server to have its dedicated thermal-controlled room, ensuring an optimal working environment as it continues to evolve.
            </p>
            <p>
                The expansion of server storage is on the horizon, incorporating three distinct spaces: a high-speed, small-volume section utilizing SSDs for frequently accessed files or swift user-to-user file transfers, a standard storage space, and an archival section designated for files older than three years.
                This strategic separation aims to streamline file organization and enhance overall storage efficiency.
